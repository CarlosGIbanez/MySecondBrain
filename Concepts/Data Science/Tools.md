# Tools

Here are some tools needed for this profession:

## Jupyter notebooks 📓

A Jupyter notebook is a "digital article" for scientist.

We can add text cells with markdown format an code cells.

This tool is extremely useful for data analysis, discovering insights and sharing results and information.

## The terminal ⚙️

Many people who use computers are afraid of the terminal, but in reality it's very simple to use.

If you master the **shell**, it will boost your producitity to the moon, since typing a command is faster than navegating trough the UI.
